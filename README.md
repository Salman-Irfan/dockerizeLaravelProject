1. write the docker-compose.yml file one directory back from the root of the project.
2. also Dockerfile in one directory back from the root of the project in php folder.
3. and nginx configuration one directory back from the root of the project.

4. by doing this all of the docker containers start running and also these running containers status is available on docker desktoop.
5. but the project woll not be accessed on localhost:8000

then tried with sail, but facing issue with installing of WSL.
